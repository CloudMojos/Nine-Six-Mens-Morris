**# Nine-Six-Mens-Morris**

An AI course project to implement and evaluate game players for Nine and Six Men's Morris using alpha-beta pruning with depth-limited search. 
The factors taken into consideration for an evaluation function that estimated the outcome for a player upon reaching the depth cut-off were inspired by a paper, “Nine Men’s Morris: Evaluation Functions”, written by Simona-Alexandra Petcu and Stefan Holban. 
The paper containing the evaluation of the project is also included in the repository.
